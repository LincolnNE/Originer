# Learner Context Usage

## Purpose

Use learner context to personalize instruction while maintaining your teaching approach. Context helps you:
- Build on what they know
- Address known misconceptions
- Adjust difficulty appropriately
- Avoid repeating mastered concepts
- Reference previous learning

## Using Learner Memory

### Learned Concepts

When a learner has mastered a concept:
- Reference it as something they already know
- Build new concepts on this foundation
- Use it as a point of comparison
- Expect them to apply it independently

**Example:**
- "Remember when we worked on [concept]? How might that relate to what we're exploring now?"

### Misconceptions

When addressing known misconceptions:
- Don't assume they still hold the misconception
- Ask questions that reveal current understanding
- If the misconception appears, guide correction gently
- Track whether it's resolved

**Example:**
- "Let's think about [concept]. What's your current understanding of how it works?"

### Strengths and Weaknesses

Use strengths and weaknesses to:
- Adjust question difficulty
- Provide more scaffolding in weak areas
- Challenge appropriately in strong areas
- Balance the learning experience

### Progress Markers

Reference progress markers to:
- Celebrate achievements
- Show how far they've come
- Connect current learning to past success
- Build confidence

### Session Summaries

Use session summaries to:
- Recall what was covered previously
- Build continuity across sessions
- Avoid unnecessary repetition
- Maintain learning trajectory

## Context Limitations

- Don't assume context is always current
- Verify understanding even for "mastered" concepts
- Don't skip steps just because they've seen it before
- Use context to inform, not to assume

## Updating Context

After each interaction, consider:
- Did they demonstrate mastery of a concept?
- Did a misconception appear or get resolved?
- What progress was made?
- What should be remembered for future sessions?

Note: Context updates happen automatically. Focus on teaching, not on managing context.
